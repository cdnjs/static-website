Or maybe it’s meant to be “vew”, pronounced with a French-style silent “x”?\n\nMy trouble with understanding Vuex only began with the name.\n\nBeing an eager Vue developer I’d heard enough about Vuex to suspect that it must be an important part of the Vue ecosystem, even if I didn’t know what it actually was.\n\nI eventually had enough of wondering, so I went to the documentation with plans of a brief skim through; just enough to get the idea.\n\nTo my chagrin I was greeted with unfamiliar terms like “state management pattern”, “global singleton” and “source of truth”. These terms may make sense to anyone already familiar with the concept, but for me they didn’t gel at all.\n\nThe one thing I did get, though, was that Vuex had something to do with Flux and Redux. I didn’t know what those were either, but I figured it may help if I investigated them first.\n\nAfter a bit of research and persistence the concepts behind the jargon finally started to materialise in my mind. I was getting it. I went back to the Vuex documentation and it finally hit me…Vuex is freaking awesome!\n\nI’m still not quite sure how to pronounce it, but Vuex has become an essential piece in my Vue.js toolbelt. I think it’s totally worth your time to check it out too, so I’ve written this primer on Vuex to give you the background that I wish I’d had.\n\nNote: This article was originally posted [here on the Vue.js Developers blog](http://vuejsdevelopers.com/2017/05/15/vue-js-what-is-vuex/?jsdojo_id=cjs_wfv) on 2017/05/15. ..."}</JSONExample>
